# Blink

A simple Arduino app to play the Mario 1-up sound (the tones were borrowed from [here](http://bikeshedeffect.weebly.com/arduino-piezo-sounds.html).

This will eventually be paired up with a Ethernet shield (Arduino expansion board) that will receive a web request when 'something' happens.

Currently I'm looking at making this play when a visitor hits my blog. I'm also looking to add a different sound when the build breaks on our TeamCity server.

More to come.
